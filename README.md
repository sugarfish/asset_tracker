Asset Tracking
==============

The asset tracker, as it has come to be known, is designed as a custom store of hardware and other items, primarily so we know where they are and what state they're in.

To Do
=====

Nothing essetial, but...

1. Could use the revised custom routing code
2. Still needs some clean-up
3. Refactor JS into single file, or at least concatenate AJAX & non-AJAX together
